# Asteroids Game Project
Basic Asteroids Game Project for practice to become familar with Git, OOP, and multi-file Projects. 

This is an amateur project that I started through boot.dev, so this isn't that great. Plenty of mistakes and not great organization, but doing this is helping me learn and build good habits.
